public class CyclicSort {
//    Cyclic sort is a comparison sorting algorithm that forces an array to be factored into a number of cycles where each of them can be rotated to produce a sorted array.
//    It is theoretically optimal in the sense that it reduces the number of writes to the original array1.
//    It is an in-place and unstable sorting algorithm12.
//
//    Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the algorithm:
//
//    1 -> Start with an unsorted array of n elements.
//    2 -> Initialize a variable, cycleStart, to 0.
//    3 -> For each element in the array, compare it with every other element to its right. If there are any elements that are smaller than the current element, increment cycleStart.
//    4 -> Once a smaller element is found, swap the current element with the first element in its cycle. The cycle is then continued until the current element returns to its original position.
//    5 -> Repeat steps 3-4 until all cycles have been completed. The array is now sorted
